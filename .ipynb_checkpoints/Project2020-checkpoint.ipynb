    "The purpose of this project is to simulate a dataset which represents income in the United States and the various factors that are associated with same. In this instance, the factors are cognitive ability and personality (Big Five traits Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism).\n",
    "\n",
    "The study of the distribution of Income and the factors that correlate with it are of interest because of questions concerning income equality and how much of success is due to so called \"fair\" factors such as personality and cognitive ability and \"unfair\" factors such as parental wealth and social status.\n",

Conscientious Adults Excel in Both Objective and Subjective Success\" [1](#ref1).\n",

    "Generally, income (including lifetime income) is best described using the lognormal distribution as the mode tends to be less than the median which is less than the mean (reflecting income equality). However, due to the earnings were capped at a taxable maximum in the paper, the data is not sufficiently skewed to justify the transformation and can be modelled as a normal distribution.\n",
