    "The purpose of this project is to simulate a dataset which represents income in the United States and the various factors that are associated with same. In this instance, the factors are cognitive ability and personality (Big Five traits Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism). In addition, the relationship between gender and income will be investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study of the distribution of Income and the factors that correlate with it are of interest because of questions concerning income equality and how much of success is due to so called \"fair\" factors such as personality and cognitive ability and \"unfair\" factors such as parental wealth and social status.\n",

    "The factor that is of primary concern in this simulation is total lifetime income in the United States (called **I** for convenience here). The aim of the project is to simulate a distribution of total lifetime income given the mean and standard deviation of total lifetime income given in the paper \"Who Does Well in Life? Conscientious Adults Excel in Both Objective and Subjective Success\" [1](#ref1). Total lifetime income is defined as the cumulative income earned on average by an individual of age 68 years with range 30-91 years (so on average lifetime income is cumulative income earned over 50 years from 18-68 years of age).\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, income (including lifetime income) is best described using the lognormal distribution as the mode tends to be less than the median which is less than the mean (reflecting income equality). However, due to the earnings were capped at a taxable maximum in the paper, the data is not sufficiently skewed to justify the transformation and can be modelled as a normal distribution.\n",

They traits are similar to IQ in that they are measured on the ordinal scale by psychologists but approximated on the interval scale as a normal distribution across a whole population [5](#ref5). The traits are measured on a scale where 4 means an individual scores extremely high in a trait, 1 means they score extremely low in a trait and 2 means the individual scores neither high nor low in a trait.\n",

Since this project's purpose is to generate a dataset which correlates with total lifetime income for people who are on average 68 years old, the expectation is that men's lifetime income will dwarf women's lifetime income because for much of the 20th century men were the sole breadwinners of households, in the United States and in other industrialised nations [6](#ref6).\n",
